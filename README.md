# Financial-Modeling-and-Valuation-projects-(MS-Excel)
This repository contains my personal Excel projects in financial modeling and valuation. Iâ€™ve built beginner-friendly models like revenue growth, and more advanced projects such as Comparable Comany Analysis, DCF, 3-statement financial models, and capital budgeting to practice applying corporate finance concepts in real-world scenarios.
