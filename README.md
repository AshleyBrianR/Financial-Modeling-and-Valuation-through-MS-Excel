# Financial-Modeling-and-Valuation-projects-(MS-Excel)
This repository showcases structured financial modeling and valuation projects built in Excel, including DCF valuation, Comparable Companies (Comps) analysis, 3-statement financial modeling, and multi-project capital budgeting. These models simulate real-world corporate finance scenarios and follow professional valuation methodologies used in investment banking and consulting workflows.
## 📊 Models Included

### 📘 1. 3-Statement Financial Model
This 3-statement financial model integrates the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement into a dynamically linked structure. It includes forecasting assumptions, working capital calculations, depreciation schedules, and financing activities, ensuring that all statements balance automatically. The model provides a foundation for valuation, scenario analysis, and further extensions like DCF and LBO modeling.

### 💵 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation Model
This project contains a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model of XYZ Company built in Excel. It includes calculation of free cash flows (FCF), weighted average cost of capital (WACC), terminal value, discounted cash flows, and enterprise value to equity value conversion, demonstrating a complete DCF valuation workflow.

### 📈 3. Comparable Companies Valuation (Comps Analysis)
This model benchmarks a target company’s valuation against a peer group using key trading multiples such as EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and P/E.
It includes company financials, calculation of valuation multiples, and derivation of an implied valuation range for the target.
Designed as a practical example to demonstrate the application of comps-based valuation in equity analysis.

### 👟 4. Capital Budgeting – Nike (Two-Project Evaluation)
This model evaluates two Nike investment projects, with Project 1 being significantly larger in scale than Project 2.
Both projects are assessed using NPV, IRR, and Payback Period to determine financial viability and potential value creation.
It includes projected cash flows, discount rate assumptions, and a comparative analysis of project outcomes.
Designed to illustrate decision-making in multi-project capital budgeting scenarios.
