# Financial-Modeling-and-Valuation-projects-(MS-Excel)
This repository showcases structured financial modeling and valuation projects built in Excel, including DCF valuation, Comparable Companies (Comps) analysis, 3-statement financial modeling, and multi-project capital budgeting. These models simulate real-world corporate finance scenarios and follow professional valuation methodologies used in investment banking and consulting workflows.
## ðŸ“Š Models Included

### 1. a. 3-Statement Financial Model- example
This 3-statement financial model integrates the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement into a dynamically linked structure. It includes forecasting assumptions, working capital calculations, depreciation schedules, and financing activities, ensuring that all statements balance automatically. The model provides a foundation for valuation, scenario analysis, and further extensions like DCF and LBO modeling.

### 2. a. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation Model- example
This project contains a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model of XYZ Company built in Excel. It includes calculation of free cash flows (FCF), weighted average cost of capital (WACC), terminal value, discounted cash flows, and enterprise value to equity value conversion, demonstrating a complete DCF valuation workflow.

### 3. a. Comparable Companies Valuation (Comps Analysis)- example
This model benchmarks a target companyâ€™s valuation against a peer group using key trading multiples such as EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, and P/E.
It includes company financials, calculation of valuation multiples, and derivation of an implied valuation range for the target.
Designed as a practical example to demonstrate the application of comps-based valuation in equity analysis.

**b. Adidas Comparable Company Valuation (Comps Model):**
This model benchmarks Adidas against key industry peers â€” Puma, Nike, and Under Armour â€” using trading multiples such as EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and P/E. After calculating enterprise and equity values for each peer, the model derives valuation ranges based on high, median, and average multiples. Using median multiples as the primary reference point, the model estimates an implied per-share valuation range for Adidas.

### 4. Capital Budgeting â€“ 
**a. Nike (Two-Project Evaluation)- example**
This model evaluates two Nike investment projects, with Project 1 being significantly larger in scale than Project 2.
Both projects are assessed using NPV, IRR, and Payback Period to determine financial viability and potential value creation.
It includes projected cash flows, discount rate assumptions, and a comparative analysis of project outcomes.
Designed to illustrate decision-making in multi-project capital budgeting scenarios.

**b. Capital Budgeting Models/Capital Budgeting Analysis â€“ Amazon Warehouse Services.**
This model evaluates two assumed warehouse expansion projects for Amazon: a large-scale Central Fulfillment Center and a smaller Regional Micro-Warehouse Hub. Five-year cash inflows and outflows were projected for both projects, followed by NPV, IRR, and Payback Period calculations. The results indicated strong financial viability, with IRR significantly exceeding the discount rate and NPV remaining positive. The analysis supports informed decision-making based on investment appraisal techniques.
